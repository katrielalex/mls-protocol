  <h1 id="rfc.abstract"><a href="#rfc.abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>Messaging applications are increasingly making use of end-to-end security mechanisms to ensure that messages are only accessible to the communicating endpoints, and not to any servers involved in delivering messages.  Establishing keys to provide such protections is challenging for group chat settings, in which more than two participants need to agree on a key but may not be online at the same time.  In this document, we specify a key establishment protocol that provides efficient asynchronous group key establishment with forward secrecy and post-compromise security for groups in size ranging from two to thousands.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft of MLS and has not yet seen significant security analysis. It should not be used as a basis for building production systems.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub. Suggested changes should be submitted as pull requests at https://github.com/mlswg/mls-protocol.  Instructions are on that page as well. Editorial changes can be managed in GitHub, but any substantive change should be discussed on the MLS mailing list.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">A group of agents who want to send each other encrypted messages needs a way to derive shared symmetric encryption keys. For two parties, this problem has been studied thoroughly, with the Double Ratchet emerging as a common solution <a href="#doubleratchet" class="xref">[doubleratchet]</a> <a href="#signal" class="xref">[signal]</a>.  Channels implementing the Double Ratchet enjoy fine-grained forward secrecy as well as post-compromise security, but are nonetheless efficient enough for heavy use over low-bandwidth networks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">For a group of size greater than two, a common strategy is to unilaterally broadcast symmetric &#8220;sender&#8221; keys over existing shared symmetric channels, and then for each agent to send messages to the group encrypted with their own sender key. Unfortunately, while this improves efficiency over pairwise broadcast of individual messages  and (with the addition of a hash ratchet) provides forward secrecy, it is difficult to achieve post-compromise security with sender keys. An adversary who learns a sender key can often indefinitely and passively eavesdrop on that sender&#8217;s messages.  Generating and distributing a new sender key provides a form of post-compromise security with regard to that sender.  However, it requires computation and communications resources that scale linearly as the size of the group.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">In this document, we describe a protocol based on tree structures that enable asynchronous group keying with forward secrecy and post-compromise security.  Based on earlier work on &#8220;asynchronous ratcheting trees&#8221; <a href="#art" class="xref">[art]</a>, the mechanism presented here use a asynchronous key-encapsulation mechanism for tree structures.  This mechanism allows the members of the group to derive and update shared keys with costs that scale as the log of the group size.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">The goal of this protocol is to allow a group of participants to exchange confidential and authenticated messages. It does so by deriving a sequence of secrets and keys known only to group members. Those should be secret against an active network adversary and should have both forward and post-compromise secrecy with respect to compromise of a participant.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">We describe the information stored by each participant as a <em>state</em>, which includes both public and private data. An initial state, including an initial set of participants, is set up by a group creator using the <em>Init</em> algorithm and based on information pre-published by the initial members. The creator sends the <em>GroupInit</em> message to the participants, who can then set up their own group state and derive the same shared secret. Participants then exchange messages to produce new shared states which are causally linked to their predecessors, forming a logical Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of states.  Participants can send <em>Update</em> messages for post-compromise secrecy and new participants can be added or existing participants removed from the group.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">The protocol algorithms we specify here follow. Each algorithm specifies both (i) how a participant performs the operation and (ii) how other participants update their state based on it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.4">There are four major operations in the lifecycle of a group:</p>
<p></p>

<li>Adding a member, initiated by a current member;</li>
<li>Adding a member, initiated by the new member;</li>
<li>Updating the leaf secret of a member;</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">Trees consist of <em>nodes</em>. A node is a <em>leaf</em> if it has no children, and a <em>parent</em> otherwise; note that all parents in our ratchet trees have precisely two children, a <em>left</em> child and a <em>right</em> child. A node is the <em>root</em> of a tree if it has no parents, and <em>intermediate</em> if it has both children and parents. The <em>descendants</em> of a node are that node, its children, and the descendants of its children, and we say a tree <em>contains</em> a node if that node is a descendant of the root of the tree. Nodes are <em>siblings</em> if they share the same parent.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">A <em>subtree</em> of a tree is the tree given by the descendants of any node, the <em>head</em> of the subtree. The <em>size</em> of a tree or subtree is the number of leaf nodes it contains.  For a given parent node, its <em>left subtree</em> is the subtree with its left child as head (respectively <em>right subtree</em>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">All trees used in this protocol are left-balanced binary trees. A binary tree is <em>full</em> (and <em>balanced</em>) if it its size is a power of two and for any parent node in the tree, its left and right subtrees have the same size. If a subtree is full and it is not a subset of any other full subtree, then it is <em>maximal</em>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.4">A binary tree is <em>left-balanced</em> if for every parent, either the parent is balanced, or the left subtree of that parent is the largest full subtree that could be constructed from the leaves present in the parent&#8217;s own subtree.  Note that given a list of <samp>n</samp> items, there is a unique left-balanced binary tree structure with these elements as leaves.  In such a left-balanced tree, the <samp>k-th</samp> leaf node refers to the <samp>k-th</samp> leaf node in the tree when counting from the left, starting from 0.</p>

The participant proposing an update to the tree transmits a representation of a set of tree nodes along the direct path from a leaf to the root. Other participants in the group can use these nodes to update their view of the tree, aligning their copy of the tree to the sender&#8217;s.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.1.p.2">To perform an update, the sender transmits a node by sending the public key for the node and an encrypted version of the secret value for the node.  The secret value is encrypted in such a way that it can be decrypted only by holders of the private key for one of its children, namely the child that is not in the direct path being transmitted.  That is, each node in the direct path is encrypted for holders of the private key for a node in the corresponding copath.  For leaf nodes, no encrypted secret is transmitted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.1.p.3">The recipient of an update processes it with the following steps:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Compute the updated secret values * Identify a node in the direct path for which the local participant has the private key * Decrypt the secret value for that node * Compute secret values for ancestors of that node by hashing the decrypted secret</li>

In a sufficiently busy group, a given member may never be able to send a handshake message, because he always loses to other members.  The degree to which this is a practical problem will depend on the dynamics of the application.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.7">It might be possible, because of the non-contributivity of intermediate nodes, that update messages could be applied one after the other without the Delivery Service having to reject any handshake message, which would make MLS more resilient regarding the concurrency of handshake messages.  The Messaging system can decide to choose the order for applying the state changes. Note that there are certain cases (if no total ordering is applied by the Delivery Service) where the ordering is important for security, ie. all updates must be executed before removes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.8">Regardless of how messages are kept in sequence, implementations MUST only update their cryptographic state when valid handshake messages are received.  Generation of handshake messages MUST be stateless, since the endpoint cannot know at that time whether the change implied by the handshake message will succeed or not.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">With this approach, the delivery service ensures that incoming messages are added to an ordered queue and outgoing messages are dispatched in the same order. The server is trusted to resolve conflicts during race-conditions (when two members send a message at the same time), as the server doesn&#8217;t have any additional knowledge thanks to the confidentiality of the messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.2">Messages should have a counter field sent in clear-text that can be checked by the server and used for tie-breaking. The counter starts at 0 and is incremented for every new incoming message. If two group members send a message with the same counter, the first message to arrive will be accepted by the server and the second one will be rejected. The rejected message needs to be sent again with the correct counter number.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.3">To prevent counter manipulation by the server, the counter&#8217;s integrity can be ensured by including the counter in a signed message envelope.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.1">Order enforcement can be implemented on the client as well, one way to achieve it is to use a two step update protocol: the first client sends a proposal to update and the proposal is accepted when it gets 50%+ approval from the rest of the group, then it sends the approved update. Clients which didn&#8217;t get their proposal accepted, will wait for the winner to send their update before retrying new proposals.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.p.2">While this seems safer as it doesn&#8217;t rely on the server, it is more complex and harder to implement. It also could cause starvation for some clients if they keep failing to get their proposal accepted.</p>

Because the value of intermediate node is determined by its last updated child, updates can be merged by recipients as long as the recipients agree on an order &#8211; the only question is which node was last updated.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">The primary purpose of the handshake protocol is to provide an authenticated group key exchange to participants. In order to protect Application messages sent among those participants, the Application secret provided by the Handshake key schedule is used to derive encryption keys for the Message Protection Layer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">Application messages MUST be protected with the Authenticated-Encryption with Associated-Data (AEAD) encryption scheme associated with the MLS ciphersuite.  Note that &#8220;Authenticated&#8221; in this context does not mean messages are known to be sent by a specific participant but only from a legitimate member of the group.  To authenticate a message from a particular member, signatures are required.  Handshake messages MUST use asymmetric signatures to strongly authenticate the sender of a message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">Each participant maintains their own chain of Application secrets, where the first one is derived based on a secret chained from the Epoch secret.  As shown in <a href="#key-schedule" class="xref">Section 5.7</a>, the initial Application secret is bound to the identity of each participant to avoid collisions and allow support for decryption of reordered messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.4">Subsequent Application secrets MUST be rotated for each message sent in order to provide stronger cryptographic security guarantees. The Application Key Schedule use this rotation to generate fresh AEAD encryption keys and nonces used to encrypt and decrypt future Application messages.  In all cases, a participant MUST NOT encrypt more than expected by the security bounds of the AEAD scheme used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.5">Note that each change to the Group through a Handshake message will cause a change of the Group Secret. Hence this change MUST be applied before encrypting any new Application message.

<p id="rfc.section.A.p.1">One benefit of using left-balanced trees is that they admit a simple flat array representation.  In this representation, leaf nodes are even-numbered nodes, with the n-th leaf at 2*n.  Intermediate nodes are held in odd-numbered nodes.  For example, a 11-element tree has the following structure:</p>
<pre>
                                             X
                     X
         X                       X                       X
   X           X           X           X           X
X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.A.p.2">This allows us to compute relationships between tree nodes simply by manipulating indices, rather than having to maintain complicated structures in memory, even for partial trees. The basic rule is that the high-order bits of parent and child nodes have the following relation (where <samp>x</samp> is an arbitrary bit string):</p>
<pre>
parent=01x =&gt; left=00x, right=10x
</pre>
